				<h3>Why we need a Water Action Initiative</h3>
				<p>
					<b>Clean waterways</b> are vital to help maintain New
					Zealand&apos;s &quot;clean&ndash;green image&quot; in the World. A
					clean and green environment is a critical part of our two most
					important export earning sectors of Agriculture and Tourism. <br />
					<br /> Human beings are having a <b>massive impact</b> on the
					freshwater environment both in terms of extracting the water we use
					and the pollution we allow to enter our lakes and rivers. New
					Zealand&ndash;Aotearoa&apos;s &apos;clean green&apos; image is
					under threat. <br /> <br /> Human beings cannot survive without
					access to clean water and water is an integral and essential part
					of the natural world that surrounds us. In New
					Zealand&ndash;Aotearoa, our freshwater environment &ndash; lakes,
					rivers and wetlands &ndash; is critical for biological diversity,
					is an important part of our <b>cultural and natural</b> heritage
					and is widely used for leisure, electricity generation,
					agricultural and domestic water supply... <br /> <br />

						Analysis of New Zealand&apos;s national water quality monitoring
						network data reveals <b>significant declines</b> in almost all
						measured water quality parameters over the last 20 years.<sup>[1]</sup>
						A 2004 study of more than 300 lowland waterways revealed that <b>96%</b>
						of them in pastoral catchments and all in urban catchments failed
						the pathogen standard for contact recreation. More than eighty per
						cent of the sites in pasture catchments exceeded guideline levels
						for phosphorous and nitrogen.<sup>[2]</sup><b>43% per cent of
							monitored lakes in New Zealand are now classed as polluted</b><sup>[3]</sup>
						and groundwater nitrate levels are rising as well with 39 per cent
						of monitored sites nationally showing increases.<sup>[4]</sup> <br />
						<br /> Human health is also directly impacted with an estimated <b>18,000
							&ndash; 34,000</b> people annually contracting waterborne diseases.<sup>[5]</sup>
						New Zealand&ndash;Aotearoa&apos;s commitment to &quot;maintain
						ecosystem integrity&quot;<sup>[6]</sup> has clearly not been met
						when it comes to the freshwater environment. Alongside pollution
						data, perhaps the starkest evidence of the decline in freshwater
						ecosystem integrity is the increasing number of threatened
						freshwater fish species. <b>More than sixty per cent</b> of New
						Zealand&apos;s native freshwater fish as well as the <b>ONLY</b>
						freshwater crayfish and mussel species are now listed as <b>threatened
							with extinction.</b><sup>[7]</sup>
						</p>
						<br /> These native fish communities are effectively the
						&apos;canaries in the coalmine&apos; of freshwater ecosystems and
						their decline reveals failures to protect freshwater ecosystems
						over the last 20 years.<sup>[8&amp;9]</sup> The declines in fish
						communities reflecting poor ecosystem health are most obvious at
						freshwater sites in pasture catchments. These declines in the
						health of freshwaters are for the most part related to
						agricultural impacts; excess sediment, phosphorous and nitrogen as
						well as faecal pathogens.<sup>[10]</sup> The major driver of the
						deterioration in the health of New Zealand&apos;s lakes,
						groundwater, rivers and streams is largely <b>unregulated
							agriculture expansion</b> and intensification, mainly in the <b>dairy
							sector.</b><sup>[11]</sup> <br /> <br /> <br /> <b>Put simply,
							more cows have meant more nutrient and pathogen pollution of
							waterways. Across the whole country, the number of dairy cows
							increased by over two million between 1992 and 2011 &ndash; an 86
							percent expansion. During the same period, average dairy herd
							size in New Zealand more than doubled from 169 to 386.</b> <sup>[12]</sup>
						<br /> <br /> <br /> Looking at a specific area, between 1990
						and 2002 the number of cows in the Waikato River catchment
						increased by 37% per cent and over that period nitrogen levels<sup>[13]</sup>
						in the river increased by 40 percent and phosphorus by 25 percent.<sup>[14]</sup>
						The intensity of dairy farming has also increased with stocking
						rates reaching a peak in the year 2009/10, almost 20 per cent
						above 1990/91 levels. These stocking rates are achieved by
						increasing use of &apos;off&ndash;farm&apos; feed supplements like
						<b>palm kernel and fossil fuel derived nitrogenous fertiliser</b>
						and imported phosphate. Imports of palm kernel have shot up from
						virtually zero to <b>14 million tonnes per year</b> in the space
						of the past 10 years, and the use of nitrogen fertiliser in New
						Zealand, according to the Ministry for the Environment, &apos;has
						increased by about 10 times since 1985 and doubled since the
						mid&ndash;1990s.&apos;<sup>[15]</sup> <br /> <br /> To date
						there has not been a charge or even any attempt to internalise the
						costs of the pollution of freshwater in New Zealand. The only cost
						for &apos;out of pipe&apos; (point source) polluters is a
						one&ndash;off &apos;consent fee&apos; which is essentially an
						administration charge required by Regional Councils. The problem
						though is that for freshwaters the biggest pollution source in New
						Zealand does not come out of a pipe, it is diffuse and this
						pollution is not controlled at all. <br /> <br /> <br /> The
						only exception to this has been in the <b>Lake Taupo catchment</b>
						were dairy farms make up only 18 per cent of the catchment but
						contribute 90 per cent of the nitrogen load to the lake. Recently,
						in order to protect the lake water quality, farm intensification
						has been reduced by means of a cap on nitrogen fertiliser. <br />
						<br /> The Government&apos;s response to the issues set out above
						has been to draw up a <b>National Policy Statement (NPS)</b> on
						freshwater to influence local and regional council
						decision&ndash;making. While the freshwater NPS is considered by
						many to be a modest step forward it is also too weak to address
						the problem.<sup>[16]</sup> There is also currently a voluntary
						scheme in operation &ndash; the <b>Clean Streams Accord</b>
						&ndash; and although this scheme has made some progress in areas
						such as farm nutrient budgeting, it lacks robust monitoring and
						enforcement so is not likely to deliver a significant reduction in
						pollution. <br /> <br /> <br /> Ultimately, without significant
						further action from both central and local government, the future
						prospects for freshwater health in New Zealand look bleak. Limits
						need to be set on how much pollution our rivers can handle and
						local, regional and national policies set in place so that these
						limits are not exceeded. <br /> <br /> <br /> A precedent for
						reducing pollution has now been set by the &apos;cap and
						trade&apos; scheme limiting nutrient use to protect Lake Taupo.
						Thus, a template is now available for that process to be adopted
						nationally. Another potentially positive change is the agreements
						made to protect and improve the health of the <b>Waikato River</b>
						resulting from a claim over the river taken to the Waitangi
						Tribunal by Tainui&ndash;Raupatu. Under this co&ndash;management
						agreement<sup>[17]</sup> Tainui&ndash;Raupatu&apos;s vision and
						strategy for cleaning up the Waikato River has been legislated,
						including the objective: &quot;<b>restoration of water quality
							within the Waikato River so that it is safe for people to swim in
							and take food from over its entire length</b>.&quot; If steps are
						taken to deliver this objective and reduce pollution it could
						offer another example of a way forward. <br /> <br /> <br />
						New Zealand faces an unprecedented freshwater crisis. The
						hands&ndash;off approach of successive New Zealand Governments
						over the last 20 years has led to a major overshoot of the
						carrying capacity of New Zealand&apos;s soils and water. There is
						a way out of the crisis but it requires full <b>acknowledgement
							of the causes</b>, setting limits on pollution and policies to ensure
						those limits are not exceeded. <br /> <br /> Excerpted from:
