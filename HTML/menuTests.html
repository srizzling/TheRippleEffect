           Why we need a Water Action Initiative



            Clean waterways are vital to help maintain New Zealand's "clean–green image" in the World. A clean and green environment is a critical part of our two most important export earning sectors of Agriculture and Tourism. 

            Human beings are having a massive impact on the freshwater environment both in terms of extracting the water we use and the pollution we allow to enter our lakes and rivers. New Zealand–Aotearoa's 'clean green' image is under threat. 

            Human beings cannot survive without access to clean water and water is an integral and essential part of the natural world that surrounds us. In New Zealand–Aotearoa, our freshwater environment – lakes, rivers and wetlands – is critical for biological diversity, is an important part of our cultural and natural heritage and is widely used for leisure, electricity generation, agricultural and domestic water supply.

           Analysis of New Zealand's national water quality monitoring network data reveals significant declines in almost all measured water quality parameters over the last 20 years.[1] A 2004 study of more than 300 lowland waterways revealed that 96% of them in pastoral catchments and all in urban catchments failed the pathogen standard for contact recreation. More than eighty per cent of the sites in pasture catchments exceeded guideline levels for phosphorous and nitrogen.[2]43% per cent of monitored lakes in New Zealand are now classed as polluted[3] and groundwater nitrate levels are rising as well with 39 per cent of monitored sites nationally showing increases.[4] 

            Human health is also directly impacted with an estimated 18,000 – 34,000 people annually contracting waterborne diseases.[5] New Zealand–Aotearoa's commitment to "maintain ecosystem integrity"[6] has clearly not been met when it comes to the freshwater environment. Alongside pollution data, perhaps the starkest evidence of the decline in freshwater ecosystem integrity is the increasing number of threatened freshwater fish species. More than sixty per cent of New Zealand's native freshwater fish as well as the ONLY freshwater crayfish and mussel species are now listed as threatened with extinction.[7]
