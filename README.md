This is our awesome project

For access to the testing server use the following:

host: root@vm3.quinlivan.co.nz (using ssh or whatever your preference is for Windows)
password: engr302

Obviously this gives root access to the server so please don't change the root password, crash it or use it 
for anything outlandish. If it goes down the please contact me john@quinlivan.co.nz or urgently on 021 153 1746
otherwise use it freely.

It presently has Ubuntu 13.04 (3.8.0-19-generic i686 - which is a 32-bit OS). There's 512MB of RAM available and
a 20GB SSD disk. The server is based in San Francisco so there may be a bit of latency but it sitting effectively
on the switch so shouldn't be too noticeable. There's a 1TB upload limit but I'd be surprised if that'll be an issue.

As of the writing of this Django is not installed however Apache 2.2.22 and MySQL are (DB username/password root/engr302)

Any problems with the test server please feel free to contact me:
